Generates a SaFe PI Planning calendar

# SaFe PI

The Scaled Agile Framework (SaFe) is a framework for scaling agile development practices to large organizations. It provides a set of principles, practices, and roles that help organizations implement agile at scale. One of the key components of SaFe is the Program Increment (PI), which is a timebox for delivering value to customers. The PI typically lasts 8-12 weeks and consists of multiple iterations or sprints.
